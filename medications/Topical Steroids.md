# Topical Steroids

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Topical steroids are applied to the skin to relieve skin conditions like swelling, redness, inflammation, itch and allergic reactions.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids) should only be applied directly to the affected areas of the skin. Follow the instructions on your medicine label for information on how often you should apply the topical steroid.
* Apply a thin layer to the affected area and stop using when there are no more symptoms. Applying too much topical steroid may increase the risk of getting side effects, while using too little may decrease the effectiveness of the medication.
* Do not bandage or cover the area after applying the medicine unless directed by the doctor. Occlusive dressing (airtight covering) may increase the amount of steroid absorbed through the skin and increase the risk of side effects.
* One fingertip unit (FTU) is the amount of cream or ointment, squeezed out of a tube (with a standard 5 mm nozzle), from the tip of an adult’s index finger to the first crease of that finger.
* One FTU (about 0.5 grams) is enough to treat an area of skin two times the size of the adult’s hand. You may use this as a guide to decide the correct amount of cream or ointment to apply on the affected area.
* A single 15 grams tube of cream or ointment contains about 30 FTUs.
