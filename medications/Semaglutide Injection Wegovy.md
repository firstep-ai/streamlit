What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Wegovy® helps to reduce weight in patients who are obese or overweight with weight-related medical problems. It also helps to lower the risk of a heart attack, stroke and death in obese patients with known heart disease.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* The starting dose of Wegovy® is 0.25 mg once a week for four weeks.
* If you can tolerate the medication, your doctor will slowly increase the dose every 4 weeks until you reach the maintenance dose of 2.4mg once a week
* Inject the dose as advised by your doctor or pharmacist.
* You should use Wegovy® on the same day each week if possible.
* If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly injection of Wegovy®, as long as it has been at least 3 days since your last Wegovy® injection. After selecting a new dosing day, once-weekly dosing should be continued.
* Do not stop using your medication without checking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* You may use this medication with or without food.

**How to select an injection site:**

Wegovy® should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You can choose to inject to your upper arms, thigh or abdomen.  
  
You should rotate the injection site every week to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).

**How to inject Wegovy®**

Wegovy® is available in two different types of injection, single-dose pen and multi-dose pen. Please refer to the respective type of injection that you are using.

Read the instruction leaflet or approach your healthcare professional for more details.

1. Turn the dose selector to your prescribed dose.

**Step 4: Inject the dose**

6. Continue pressing the dose button while keeping the needle in your skin.
