What else should I know about this medication?
----------------------------------------------

To prevent malaria, you may protect yourself against mosquito bites by:

* Wearing long-sleeved clothing and long trousers between sunset and sunrise.
* Applying insect repellent containing more than 20% DEET (N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide) for adults or 10% and less DEET for children on exposed skin. DEET is a common active ingredient in mosquito repellents.
* Using mosquito coils in the room at night.
* Sleep with mosquito nets around your bed, with the net edges tucked under the bed or sleep in a screened room.
* Spray insecticide where mosquitos may rest. Mosquito larvae survive well in clear, slow-flowing streams.
* Avoid going to an area where malaria is common.

Following these guidelines and medication does not mean that you will not get malaria. If you have a fever or experience chills between 1 week and up to 1 year after your return, you should seek medical attention. Inform the doctor that you have been to a country where malaria is common. Malaria can be effectively treated if discovered early. A delay in treatment may result in serious health problems.
