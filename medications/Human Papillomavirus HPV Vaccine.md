# Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

What is the HPV Vaccine Used For?
---------------------------------

HPV vaccines help to prevent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which may lead to cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, or anal cancer and genital warts in both women and men.

HPV infection spreads from one person to another through skin-to-skin contact such as during sexual activity, or less frequently during delivery from an infected mother to her baby.

Most HPV infections, including the strains that can cause cervical cancer, do not have any signs or symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include abnormal vaginal bleeding such as bleeding after menstrual periods or after sex. There may also be changes in the amount, colour or smell of vaginal discharge. It is recommended to have regular screening, e.g. Pap smear to detect cervical cancer early.

What are the types of HPV vaccines available in Singapore?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are two types of HPV vaccines available in Singapore. They are the HPV2 (Cervarix), and HPV9 (Gardasil 9). Cervarix provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which account for 70% of all cervical cancers, and have been shown to be both clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting. It is registered for use in females. Gardasil 9 provides protection against an additional 20% of cancer-causing HPV types. It is registered for use in both females and males.
