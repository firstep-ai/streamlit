What is this medication for?

Calcitonin nasal spray contains the man-made active protein called calcitonin-salmon. It is similar to a hormone in the human body that regulates calcium level.

Calcitonin nasal spray is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women when alternative treatments are not suitable. Osteoporosis is a condition which causes bones to become weak and brittle. Menopause reduces the level of certain hormones in the body thus leading to increased risk of osteoporosis.

 Calcitonin nasal spray can also be used for other indications as prescribed by your doctor.
