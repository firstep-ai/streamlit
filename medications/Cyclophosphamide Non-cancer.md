# Cyclophosphamide (Non-cancer)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Cyclophosphamide belongs to a class of medications called immunosuppressants. It reduces the body's immune response by stopping or slowing the growth of immune cells. It helps to reduce inflammation, improve symptoms, reduce flares and stops disease from getting worse.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* It may be given by

  + Intravenous infusion (inject into the blood vessel). This has to be done in the hospital for typically a few hours.
  + Orally (by mouth)

    - Take the tablets with or after food to reduce stomach upset. It can cause nausea and vomiting at the start of therapy, but if the dose is increased slowly, your body will usually get used to it.
    - Do not take the tablets at bedtime to minimize the risk of irritation to the bladder when urine accumulates overnight.
    - The tablets should be swallowed whole, with a glass of water. The tablets should not be crushed or chewed.
* Dosage and duration of cyclophosphamide will depend on your body weight, disease activity and response to the medication.
* This medication does not work immediately. It may take between 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Thus, it is important that you take your medication or come back for infusion regularly, otherwise the benefits will not be seen.
* Do not stop your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* Other medications such as corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be taken with cyclophosphamide.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dose. Do not take double doses to make up for the missed dose.

If you miss your infusion appointment, book another appointment as soon as possible. Inform your doctor about the missed/ late dose.
