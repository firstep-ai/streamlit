# Anti-Diarrhoeal

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Anti-diarrhoeals help to relieve diarrhoea. They may include medications such as:

* Activated charcoal
* Kaolin
* Dioctahedral smectite
* Lactobacillus Acidophilus
* Loperamide
* Diphenoxylate

Activated charcoal, kaolin and dioctahedral smectite work by binding to the toxins in your stomach. Lactobacillus Acidophilus has been suggested to work by protecting the gut lining and maintaining healthy bacteria in your stomach. Loperamide and diphenoxylate work by slowing your stomach  movement. They may be found in liquid, powder, capsule or tablet form. Oral rehydration salts may also be used to replace water and salts lost through diarrhoea.
