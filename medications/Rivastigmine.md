# Rivastigmine

Rivastigmine is used to reduce symptoms of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s dementia, or other types of dementia. Learn how to use the medication, its common side effects, special precautions to watch out for, and more.

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Rivastigmine belongs to a class of medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It is used to reduce symptoms of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s dementia, or other types of dementia, such as:

* Difficulty in remembering recent events, activities, or the names of familiar people or things
* Poor concentration and judgement

It will not cure or stop the dementia from getting worse, but it may improve the ability to think in some patients and slow down the worsening of these symptoms.

Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.
