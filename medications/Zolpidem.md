**This medication may be habit-forming when taken excessively or for a prolonged duration** (especially at high doses). This may result in:

* Unintentional, regular use of the medication
* Dependence or over-reliance on the medication
* Decreased effectiveness of the medication

      This can be prevented by taking the medication:

* On a short-term basis (2 - 4 weeks)
* At the lowest effective dose
* Intermittently (for example, taking it once every 2 or 3 nights for relieving sleep difficulty)

If you have been taking the medication on a long-term basis or at high doses, do not stop taking it abruptly as it may lead to withdrawal symptoms such as increased sweating, increased heart rate, tremors, trouble sleeping, increased agitation, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that do not exist), increased anxiety, nausea or vomiting, and in severe cases, medical emergencies such as fits.

If you wish to cut down, discuss with your doctor to come up with a plan to help you on this. It is often best to reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks.
