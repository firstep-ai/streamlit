# Nicotine Replacement Therapy – Gum (Nicorette®, Nicotinell®)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the other harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when you are trying to quit smoking, allowing you to focus on the other aspects in your effort to quit smoking.

Nicotine gum releases a dose of nicotine when chewed to reduce the urge to smoke.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

When you feel the urge to smoke, chew one gum to release a taste or until you feel a tingling sensation then park the gum between your cheek and gum. Continue chewing the gum when the taste has faded. Repeat for about 30 minutes until the gum has no more taste, then spit it out. You can chew on one gum every 1-2 hours.

Do not swallow the gum.

Do not use more than the recommended maximum number of gums as instructed by your healthcare professional or use more than one gum each time.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You should stop smoking once you start to use NRT. Smoking and using NRT at the same time may increase the risk of adverse effects from the additive effects of nicotine in your body.

If you continue to feel the urge to smoke or experience severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms even after using the NRT gums, please inform your healthcare professional as you may need other types of NRT.

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* You recently had a heart attack or stroke.
* You have active peptic ulcer disease.
* You are using dentures.
* You have any other medical conditions.
* You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.

* Throat irritation
* Jaw ache
* Increased salivation

What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

What food or medication should I avoid when I take or use this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Avoid coffee, tea, juices, acidic and fizzy drinks 15 minutes before and during use of nicotine gum as this may reduce nicotine absorption.

+ Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, lorazepam)
+ Insulin

+ Opioid painkillers (e.g. codeine)
