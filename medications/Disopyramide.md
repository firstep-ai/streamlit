# Disopyramide

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

This medication is used to suppress and prevent the recurrence of abnormal heart rhythm.

Your doctor may use this medication to treat other heart conditions such as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a condition involving the thickening of the heart muscle. This condition results in obstruction to blood flowing out of the heart, which may cause breathlessness and chest discomfort during exertion.

Disopyramide slows the heart rate and makes the heart contract less forcefully. It also helps reduce obstruction of blood flow in the heart in patients with HCM. This may help to improve symptoms such as breathlessness and chest discomfort. It may be used in combination with other heart medications such as a beta- blocker (e.g. Bisoprolol, Atenolol) or a calcium channel-blocker (e.g. Diltiazem).
