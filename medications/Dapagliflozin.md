What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar (glucose) back into the blood, and this increases the amount of sugar that is removed in the urine. It is used in the treatment of diabetes. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels.

If you suffer from heart failure, this medication can also be given to you to help with your heart condition, even if you do not have diabetes.

If you suffer from certain kidney problems, this medication can also be given to help to lower the risk of worsening kidney problems, even if you do not have diabetes.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Follow the instructions on your medication label and take the medication as prescribed by your doctor. It is usually taken once a day. You may take this medication before food or after food.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you missed a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time.

If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.

Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.
