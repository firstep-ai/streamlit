# Polio Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

What is the Polio Vaccine Used For?
-----------------------------------

Polio vaccines help to prevent infection caused by three types of Poliovirus. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) contains the killed form of the Poliovirus.

Poliomyelitis (Polio) is a highly infectious disease which can affect the muscles and nerves throughout the body. In a small number of people, this can lead to permanent paralysis of the limbs. Most people infected with polio will not have any symptoms or have only minor symptoms which often go away completely.

Polio is spread by contact with infected people, such as through oral contact with body fluids or faecal material from an infected person. Some symptoms that can happen at the beginning include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness and pain in the limbs.

Who Should Receive the Polio Vaccine?
-------------------------------------

As part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), all children should receive a series of three doses from age 2 months onwards, followed by two booster doses at appropriate intervals, usually given together in combination with other vaccines.

For at-risk unvaccinated adults, their vaccination schedule may differ and booster dose may be advised if indicated. Please consult your doctor for more information.

What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the Polio Vaccine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine, including antibiotics Neomycin, Streptomycin or Polymyxin B

* You are currently not feeling well and having a fever

How Is the Polio Vaccine Given?
-------------------------------

IPV is given by injection into a muscle, as a series of three doses followed by two booster shots. It may be given on its own as one shot, or in combination with other vaccines (e.g. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, and Haemophilus Influenzae type b-Hib) as one shot.

What Are Some Common Side Effects of the Polio Vaccine?
-------------------------------------------------------

  + Sit for 15 minutes to avoid fainting
