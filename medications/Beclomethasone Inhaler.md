# Beclomethasone Inhaler

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Beclomethasone inhaler is a steroid inhaler that helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the lungs. Beclomethasone inhaler is normally referred to as ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to control symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Use your Beclomethasone inhaler every day to control your condition, unless otherwise informed by your healthcare professional.
* Please refer to your Beclomethasone inhaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

* If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
* You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
* You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
* You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.

Beclomethasone inhaler will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. The signs include:

* Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
* Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
* Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

+ You can prevent these side effects by rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing, after using your Beclomethasone inhaler.
