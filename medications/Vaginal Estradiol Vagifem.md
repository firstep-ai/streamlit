Vagifem® is a type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that contains a low dose of natural estrogen (estradiol), which is a female hormone. It is used to treat vaginal irritation, dryness, and pain during sexual intercourse, these symptoms are caused by decreased levels of estrogen, which happens naturally after menopause. Vagifem® works by replacing the estrogen.
