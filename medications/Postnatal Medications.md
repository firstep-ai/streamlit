| **​Other considerations** | ​There are many types of NSAIDs available; however not all NSAIDs are safe for breast-feeding. If you are taking any NSAIDs other than the ones stated in this leaflet, please check with your healthcare professional if it is safe to be used while you are breast-feeding. |

| **​How to take** | As antacids may come in tablet or liquid form, always follow the instructions provided. Most antacids are usually chewable tablets and you should chew them before taking the NSAIDs.  Famotidine is usually given once or twice daily, and can be taken together with NSAIDs. |

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

You should take multivitamins and iron supplements regularly. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.  
Most of the other post-natal medications are only to be taken if you have symptoms, if you have no symptoms, you do not need to take the medication.

What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

* Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue
* Difficulty in breathing
* Skin rashes

If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the supplement and seek immediate medical attention.

How should I store this medication?
-----------------------------------

Follow the instructions on the medication label. Keep this medication away from children.

How do I throw away this medication safely?
-------------------------------------------

Pack this medication into a black trash bag and seal it tightly before throwing it into the rubbish chute or bin.

What else should I know about this medication?
----------------------------------------------

* Drink at least 8-10 cups of fluids daily. This replaces fluids lost through breastfeeding and also helps to relieve constipation. Be sure to avoid sugar sweetened drinks!
* Have a supply of staple food items (e.g. rice/noodles/pasta, eggs, frozen vegetables) so that quick easy meals can be made
* Cook extras at dinner and freeze in single portions to use at busy times.
* Have healthy snacks readily available for convenience when hungry (e.g. tubs of yogurt, dried fruit and nuts, wholemeal crackers, fruit).
* You should try to limit alcohol consumption while you are breast-feeding. Generally, moderate alcohol intake by the breast-feeding mother (up to 1 standard drink a day) is not known to be harmful. You should also:
  + Wait for at least 3 hours after alcohol consumption before the next breastfeed.
  + Avoid alcohol completely in the 1st week after delivery as (i) baby’s liver is not completely mature, and (ii) to allow establishment of breast milk supply so that breast milk can be pumped and stored for later use in case baby needs an earlier feed.
* Limit to 2 cups of coffee or tea per day as caffeine has been shown to pass to babies through breast milk.
