# Finasteride (for Hair Loss)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Finasteride is approved to treat male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia).

In the scalp, finasteride lowers the levels of a male hormone (dihydrotestosterone), which is a major cause of male pattern hair loss. In this way, finasteride helps to slow the balding process, preventing further hair loss, and leading to increased hair growth in some patients.

The improvement rate varies from person to person; it usually occurs after the medication has been used for at least 3 months and lasts only as long as the medication continues to be used. Hair loss will begin again within 3 to 6 months after stopping the medication.

This medication is also used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.
