What is this medication for?
----------------------------

* Methotrexate is a medicine that reduces over-activity of the immune system. It is used to treat various autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, uveitis, and inflammatory myositis (muscle inflammation).
* In arthritis, methotrexate acts as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that helps to reduce pain, swelling, and long-term joint damage.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* A typical weekly dose of methotrexate ranges from 7.5mg to 25mg, given in the form of tablets or injection. Dosage may vary depending on your disease activity and response to the medicine.
* Tablets should be taken with or after food. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, without chewing or crushing. Wash hands thoroughly after administration.
* Folic or folinic acid (also called folate) is often given to reduce the risk of some side effects. It is usually taken a day before or after methotrexate unless advised otherwise by your doctor.
* The beneficial effects of methotrexate will begin after 6 weeks and the full benefits may not be seen until after 12 weeks of treatment. Thus, it is important that you take your medication regularly, otherwise you may not benefit at all.
* Medications, such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other DMARDs may be taken with methotrexate.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

* If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember if it is within 2 days from your scheduled dose. For example, if your scheduled dose is on Sunday and you remember your forgotten dose on Tuesday, take the dose on Tuesday and resume the Sunday schedule in the same week. Skip the dose if 3 or more days have lapsed since the missed dose. Do not take double doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
* You are taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medicines, supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
* Inform your doctor if you have any liver disease (e.g. jaundice, hepatitis) or if any of your family members has hepatitis.

Conception and breastfeeding precautions:

* For female patients, please inform your doctor if you intend to conceive or breastfeed. This is because methotrexate can cause miscarriage and serious birth defects, and should be avoided before conceiving and during pregnancy. Reliable contraceptive measures must be used to avoid unplanned pregnancy whilst taking methotrexate. Patients should also wait at least three months after stopping methotrexate before trying for a child. In addition, women are advised not to breastfeed as methotrexate is excreted into the breast milk.
* For male patients who are considering to have children, the continued use of methotrexate may be considered. Please discuss with your primary rheumatologist.
