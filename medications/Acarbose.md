What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Acarbose is used in the treatment of diabetes. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels. It works by slowing down the breakdown of carbohydrates from our diet to simple sugars. Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice. Absorption of sugar from the digestive system is slowed down. This prevents the rise of blood sugar after a meal.
