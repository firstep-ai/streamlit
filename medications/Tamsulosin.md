# Tamsulosin

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Tamsulosin belongs to a group of medications known as alpha-1 blockers. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.

Tamsulosin can be used alone or with another medication called Dutasteride to treat enlarged prostate gland.

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.
