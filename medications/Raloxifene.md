# Raloxifene

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

When a woman reaches menopause, the levels of the female sex hormone, estrogen, decreases. The decrease in estrogen may also cause the bones to become thinner, weaker and easier to break, causing a condition called osteoporosis.

Raloxifene belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by mimicking some of the helpful effects of estrogen after menopause.
