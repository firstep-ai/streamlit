What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Domperidone is used to provide relief from nausea and vomiting.

It may also be used to provide relief from symptoms of indigestion, such as bloating, excessive fullness, stomach discomfort, excessive burping and heartburn after eating.

Domperidone works by blocking the action of a chemical messenger, dopamine, which helps to stop you from feeling sick (nausea) and prevents vomiting. It also works to increase movement of food through the stomach and intestines more easily, which helps to relieve the symptoms of bloating, fullness and indigestion.

Domperidone may also be used for other medical conditions, please check with your healthcare professional.
