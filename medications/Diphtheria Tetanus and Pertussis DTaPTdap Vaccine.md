# Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP/Tdap) Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

​What is the DTaP/Tdap Vaccine Used For?
----------------------------------------

DTaP/Tdap vaccines help to prevent diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Diphtheria and pertussis are infectious diseases which spread from one person to another through the air, via coughs or sneezes. Tetanus is not easily spread from person to person but is a serious disease affecting the nerves, and enters the body through cuts or wounds.

Diphtheria - Diphtheria bacteria causes breathing difficulties, problems with swallowing, heart failure, paralysis, and death.

Tetanus - Tetanus bacteria produce a toxin that causes “lockjaw” resulting in painful muscle contractions, which interferes with breathing and swallowing, leading to death.

Pertussis - Pertussis bacteria cause uncontrollable, violent coughing (“whooping cough”) which results in breathing difficulties, as well as problems in eating or drinking.

What Are the Types of DTaP/Tdap Vaccine Available?
--------------------------------------------------

There are two types of vaccines available, which differ in their diphtheria and pertussis content:

1. DTaP: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis
2. Tdap: Tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis content
