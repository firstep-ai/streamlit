​This leaflet explains the correct method of breaking and administering Vitamin K orally from the glass ampoules.

The glass ampoules are designed to ensure a clean break, provided the following steps are followed:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **​Step 1:**  * Shake the ampoule until all the solution is at the bottom of the ampoule. * The solution should be clear; **do not use it if it looks cloudy.** | **Step 2:**  * Hold the bottom part of the ampoule between the thumb and first finger of one hand. * Ensure that the **spot** on the ampoule is facing **towards** you. |
| **Step 3:**  * If possible, cover the top of the ampoule with a tissue or towel. Then hold the top of the ampoule between the thumb and first finger of your other hand. | **​Step 4:**  * Snap the top of the ampoule off by pushing **away** from the side with the **spot**. |
| **​Step 5:**  * Place the syringe (provided together with the ampoule) vertically into the ampoule. * Withdraw the solution into the syringe until it reaches the correct marking on the syringe. * Hold the syringe against the light to check whether the solution is clear and also ensure that no glass pieces are stuck to the tip of the dispenser. * If unsure, expel the solution into a small cup to check for any glass pieces – if the solution is clear, withdraw again from the cup into the syringe. | **Step 6:**  * Administer the contents of the syringe directly into the mouth. |
