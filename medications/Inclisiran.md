# Inclisiran

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Inclisiran is a small piece of RNA that is absorbed by the liver to increase the liver’s ability to remove bad cholesterol. This lowers the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ in the blood.

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause blood vessels to clog up and this may lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. By reducing the amount of bad cholesterol in the body, this medication reduces the risk of future heart attack and stroke.

This medication may also be used for patients with high ‘bad cholesterol’ levels in their blood because of a hereditary condition (a medical condition that runs in the family).
