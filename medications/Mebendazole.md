What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Mebendazole is used to treat worm infections. 

It is used mainly for infections of the gut such as threadworms and other less common worm infections (whipworm, roundworm and hookworm). It works by stopping worms from using sugar (glucose) to live, thus killing the worms.
