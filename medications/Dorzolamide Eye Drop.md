# Dorzolamide Eye Drop

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Dorzolamide belongs to a class of medications called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where the nerve in the eye is damaged, and is usually associated with increased eye pressure. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Dorzolamide helps to lower the pressure in your eye by reducing production of fluid in the eye.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Proper use of eye drop

+ Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
+ Tilt your head backwards and look up.
+ Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
+ Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
+ Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
+ If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
+ If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first.
