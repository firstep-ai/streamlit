# Nevirapine

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Nevirapine is an antiretroviral medication used for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It works by preventing the virus from reproducing and hence reducing the amount of virus in your body. This increases the CD4 cell count in your body. CD4 cells are a type of immune cells that help your body fight infections.

Nevirapine is not a cure for HIV infection. It must be taken consistently every day with your other antiretroviral medications to slow the progression of the disease.
