# Alfuzosin

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Alfuzosin  belongs to a group of medications known as alpha-1 blockers. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

* You are undergoing cataract (cloudiness of the lens) eye surgery. Inform your eye specialist before the operation that you are taking or have previously taken the medication. The pupil may dilate poorly and the iris (the coloured part of the eye) may become floppy during the operation. It is important for the eye specialist to be aware of this as the operation may need to be carried out differently.

You may experience dizziness or light-headedness, which may be caused by low blood pressure upon standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. In order to reduce the likelihood that these symptoms occur, you should be on a regular daily dose of your alpha1-blocker medications (such as Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin) before you start medications for erectile dysfunction.
