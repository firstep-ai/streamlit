# Fludrocortisone (for Low Blood Pressure)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid and is used to replace the steroid hormone that your body lacks. Corticosteroids are medications which act in the same way as steroid hormones and are used to replace the body’s own production when the adrenal glands (that produces steroid hormones) are not working normally.

This medication can help patients who have low blood pressure. Fludrocortisone increases the blood pressure by increasing the salt level in the body which in turn increases the volume of the blood.
