# Tafamidis

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Tafamidis is used in the treatment of cardiac amyloidosis. This is a protein disorder in which clumps of abnormal protein are produced by your liver and build up in the heart. This causes your heart muscles to stiffen, making it harder for your heart to pump blood around your body.

This medication works by stabilising these abnormal proteins to slow down the build-up of these deposits. By doing so, it can slow down the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of hospitalisations related to heart problems.
