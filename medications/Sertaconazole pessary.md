What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Sertaconazole pessaries are used to treat vaginal thrush (also known as vulvovaginal candidiasis). Vaginal thrush is caused by an overgrowth of a fungus known as *Candida albicans*. This infection causes symptoms such as itching, swelling and a thick, white odourless discharge. This medication will prevent the growth of the fungus and clear the infection.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Insert one pessary into your vagina as deeply as possible, in a lying position in the evening, just before bedtime.
* Usually, only a single dose is required for treatment.
* Avoid vaginal intercourse during the period of treatment, until the symptoms are fully cleared.
* You may consider using a panty liner during the treatment to absorb any discharge.
* Do not use tampons, intravaginal douches, spermicides or other products in the vagina when you are using this medication.
* The treatment is not to be carried out during menstruation, as it may be less effective.
