What is this medication for?
----------------------------

​Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is commonly used to treat pain and reduce inflammation. It can also be used to bring down the body temperature during a fever and to relieve headaches, joint or muscle pain/inflammation, gout attacks, toothaches, and menstrual pain.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Ibuprofen should be best taken with meals to reduce stomach irritation. Your healthcare professional may also give you an additional medication to protect the stomach. E.g. Famotidine, Omeprazole.

Ibuprofen comes as tablets and liquid medications. It is available over the counter without a prescription for short-term relief of fever, mild to moderate pain and inflammation (redness, swelling and soreness). ​As there are different strengths and dosage forms for Ibuprofen, please make sure to take it as recommended on the label. Please check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure.

Do not exceed the dose recommended on the label as taking too much Ibuprofen over time may cause serious stomach, kidney or heart problems.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

​Ibuprofen can be taken on as needed basis for short term use as prescribed by the doctor. 

If your doctor has prescribed the medication for you to be taken regularly, do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.
