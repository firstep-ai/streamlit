What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Iron is a type of mineral naturally found in some foods that helps the body to produce red blood cells. It is used to treat or prevent iron deficiency anemia, a condition that occurs when the body has insufficient healthy red blood cells to provide oxygen to the body. Iron deficiency anemia may be due to a poor diet, excessive bleeding (e.g. heavy menses), or as a result of other medical problems (e.g. chronic kidney problems).

During pregnancy, iron supplementation helps meet the increased iron needs of both the mother and the developing baby.

Iron supplements may be available on its own (e.g. Iron Polymaltose), or as a combination product (e.g. Iron Gluconate Co).
