# Zidovudine

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Zidovudine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It works by preventing the virus from replicating (reproducing), and hence, reducing the amount of viruses (viral load) in your body. This increases the CD4 cell count in your body. CD4 cells are a type of immune cells that help your body fight off infections. However,  Zidovudine is not a cure for HIV infection. It must be taken consistently every day to slow the progression of the disease. It is usually given in combination with other anti-retroviral medications (combination therapy). 

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. Stopping medication may result in worsening infection and/ or acquisition of other infections.
* It is important to take the antiretroviral combination therapy exactly as prescribed every day to prevent the virus from becoming resistant to the medication.
* You may take this medication with or without food.
