# Prilocaine and Lignocaine

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

* This medication contains two topical anaesthetics, lignocaine and prilocaine. When applied to the skin, it causes temporary numbing of the skin (short term loss of sensation to the skin area)
* It is used before procedures or injections to relieve the feeling of pain caused by the procedures or injections.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Squeeze out the prescribed quantity of the cream on the area of the skin where the procedure or injection is to be done. Do not rub EMLA cream into the skin.
* Take one of the occlusive dressings provided, and remove the cut-out piece in the middle
* Peel the paper liner from the framed dressing.
* Cover the EMLA cream with this dressing so that you get a thick layer of cream between your skin and the dressing. Do not spread out the cream. Press down on the sides of the dressing carefully to avoid leakages. It is important to cover EMLA cream with an air-tight dressing to ensure that the cream enters the skin properly and numbs the skin
* Remove the frame of the dressing. Write down the time the cream was applied, directly on the dressing.
* Wash your hands immediately after using EMLA.
* Remove the dressing and wipe off the cream after the recommended duration of application in the table below or as advised by your doctor.
