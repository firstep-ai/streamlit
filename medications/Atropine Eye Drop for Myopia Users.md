# Atropine Eye Drop (for Myopia Users)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Atropine eye drop helps to slow down the progression of myopia in children and teenagers. Myopia, also known as near-sightedness or short-sightedness, is a condition where a person can see near objects well (when reading a book or working on the computer) but has difficulty seeing objects that are far away (road signs or bus numbers).

Usually a low dose of atropine (0.01% to 0.10%) will be prescribed first. If the dose is not effective in slowing down short-sightedness, a higher dose of atropine (0.5% to 1.0%) may be prescribed.

How should I take or use this medication?

  + If your child needs to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if your child is using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any interactions between different eye drops.
  + If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, your child should use the eye drops first.

* Your child should not stop using medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If your child forgets to use a dose, use it as soon as you remember. Then use your next dose at the usual time. Do not use two doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* Your child is allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication.
* Your child is taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
* Your child has a history of closed-angle or narrow-angle glaucoma. (This is a condition where the fluid drainage structure inside the eye gets blocked. This results in fluid buildup and increased eye pressure that damages the eye’s nerve.)
* Your child is using any other eye preparations.

What are some common side effects of this medication?
-----------------------------------------------------

* Eye stinging or burning sensation
* Eye redness
* Glare/ Sensitivity to bright light (usually only with higher doses)

  + Tinted glasses, sunglasses or hats may be used to reduce glare
* Blurring of near vision (usually only with higher doses)

  + Your child may have difficult doing any activities that require concentration (e.g reading/close work)

Side effects of glare/blurring of near vision are less likely to occur with low-dose atropine. Check with your healthcare professional if these conditions are severe or do not improve.
