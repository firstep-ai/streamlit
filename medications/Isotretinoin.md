What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Isotretinoin is used to treat severe acne that has not responded to other acne medications. It reduces the amount of oil produced by the glands in the skin and clears inflammation.

This medication may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Isotretinoin is available in the form of capsules. Take this medication as directed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the capsule. Take this medication with or after food.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
* You have diabetes, high cholesterol or triglycerides (fat in the blood), liver or kidney disease
* You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
* You are planning to undergo any surgical or dental procedures
* You are planning to undergo any skin or hair removal procedures e.g. waxing, dermabrasions, facial peels, laser treatments. This medication may cause skin to become more fragile, increasing the risk of poor wound healing and scar formation. Avoid these procedures during treatment and for at least 6 months after stopping the medication.
* You are planning to donate blood. Do not donate blood when taking the medication and for at least 1 month after stopping the medication. This is to prevent passing donated blood to a pregnant woman and causing harm to the baby.

For female patients:

* Isotretinoin has been reported to cause ***serious harm to unborn babies*** when taken during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant, who intend to become pregnant, or who are breast-feeding should tell their doctors before taking this medication.
* You must use strict birth control for at least 1 month before you start isotretinoin, for the whole time you are taking isotretinoin and for at least 1 month after discontinuing this medication. Discuss contraception with your doctor or pharmacist.
* Before you start taking your course of isotretinoin, you should wait until the 2nd or 3rd day of your next menstrual period. If you suspect you are pregnant, do not start the isotretinoin at all.
* If you are already taking isotretinoin and discover that you have become pregnant, stop taking it immediately and tell your doctor.

-----------------------------------------------------

In some people, the acne may seem to get worse during the first few weeks before improving.
