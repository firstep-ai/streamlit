How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* For proper use of eye drop:

+ Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label
+ Shake the bottle
+ Tilt your head backwards and look up
+ Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface
+ Close your eyes and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed and prevent it from being drained into the back of your throat
+ If you need to use more than 1 drop of medicine, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medicine from being washed away by the second drop of medicine before it has time to work. This also prevents any medicine interactions between different eye drops
+ If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first

* For contact lens wearers:

+ Remove your contact lens before each application of medication
+ If you are using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops
+ If you are using soft lens, you can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye drops. Otherwise, your lens may be damaged by the preservatives present in the eye drops
+ If you need to apply eye drops twice a day, it is recommended that you apply them once in the morning before you put on your lens, and at the end of the day after you remove your lens
