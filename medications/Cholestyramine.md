# Cholestyramine

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

This medication may be used to lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) in the body. It may also help increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol). High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and increase the risk for chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, this medication can help reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.

This medication may also be used in some patients to treat itch caused by a long term liver disease known as primary biliary cirrhosis, where the bile ducts (tubes that carry bile fluid) in your liver are slowly destroyed.
