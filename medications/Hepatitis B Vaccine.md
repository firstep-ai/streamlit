# Hepatitis B Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

​What is the Hepatitis B Vaccine Used For?
------------------------------------------

Hepatitis B vaccines help to prevent infection caused by the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).

Hepatitis B can lead to serious liver disease, and is spread by direct contact with blood or other body fluids from an infected person. It can also spread by sharing items such as toothbrushes or razors with an infected person.  A baby whose mother is infected may become infected at birth unless the necessary vaccines are given.

Common symptoms of Hepatitis B include jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and joint pain.

Who Should Receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine?
-------------------------------------------

As part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), all children should receive three doses at appropriate intervals. Infants should get their first dose at birth and will usually complete the series by 6 months of age, however sometimes it may take longer than 6 months to complete the series.

As part of the Singapore National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), adults (18 years or older) who have not been previously vaccinated, or lack evidence of past infection or immunity should receive three doses (the first dose, followed by the second and third dose at one month and six months after the first dose).
