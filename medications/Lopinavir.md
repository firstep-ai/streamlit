# Lopinavir

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Lopinavir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. For it to be effective, Lopinavir must be taken together with a boosting agent, Ritonavir, and in combination with other antiretroviral medications. This combination therapy (available as a fixed-dose tablet/ oral solution) works by preventing the virus from replicating (reproducing), and hence, reducing the amount of viruses (viral load) in your body. As a result, the CD4 cell count in your body will increase. CD4 cells are a type of immune cells that help your body fight off infections. However, Lopinavir/Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection. It must be taken consistently every day to slow the progression of the disease.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. The medication may make you feel better over time but do not stop taking it even if you feel better. Stopping the medication may result in a worsening of the infection and/ or acquisition of other infections.
* It is important to take the antiretroviral combination therapy exactly as prescribed every day to prevent the virus from becoming resistant to the medication.
* Take this medication with food to minimise side effects and increase absorption. Lopinavir/ Ritonavir will not be able to work well without food. It can be a meal or a snack.
* Lopinavir/ Ritonavir tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or split the tablets.
