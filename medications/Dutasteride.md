# Dutasteride

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), a non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland, caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. It lowers dihydrotestosterone, and thus shrinks the prostate and relieves the symptoms. Therefore, this medication is for use in men only. It may take up to 6 months or more for you to notice an effect.

As the prostate enlarges, it can lead to urinary problems such as difficulty in passing urine and frequent visits to the toilet. It can also cause the flow of urine to be slower and weaker. If left untreated, there is a risk that the urine flow may be completely blocked (acute urinary retention) and this requires immediate medical treatment.

Dutasteride can be used alone or with another medication called Tamsulosin to treat enlarged prostate.

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.
