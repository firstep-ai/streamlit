# Tacrolimus

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is also used to treat lupus nephritis, an inflammation of the kidney that is caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

In rheumatoid arthritis, Tacrolimus suppresses your immune system and prevents it from attacking your joints and causing inflammation. This helps to reduce symptoms of joint swelling, pain and stiffness. In the long term, it also reduces joint deformity and bone erosion from the inflammatory condition.

In lupus nephritis, Tacrolimus suppresses your immune system and prevents it from attacking your kidney. This helps to reduce kidney damage and leakage of proteins in your urine (proteinuria).

This medication may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.
