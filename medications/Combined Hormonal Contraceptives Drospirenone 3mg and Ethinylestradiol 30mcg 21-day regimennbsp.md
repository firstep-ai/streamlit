What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Drospirenone 3mg / Ethinylestradiol 30mcg (e.g. Yasmin®, Liza®) is a combined hormonal contraceptive with a 21-day regimen. It contains two types of female hormones, estrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progestogen (drospirenone). This medication can help prevent ovulation and regulates other naturally occurring hormones in the body. When taken correctly, this prevents pregnancy and promotes regular menstrual bleeding.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* If you are switching from other forms of contraception, please seek advice from your healthcare professional.
* You should take this medication after food.
* You may start taking this medication on the first or second day of your menses (if this is your first time taking hormonal contraceptives or restarting this medication after a break).
* If you are also using it for contraceptive purposes, a barrier method of contraception (e.g. condoms), is recommended for the first 7 days of taking this medication for the first time.
* You should take one tablet daily for 21 days in a row, preferably at the same time every day.  After completion of the pack, there will be 7 days where you do not need to take any tablets (7-day tablet-free interval), during which you will experience withdrawal bleeding (menses) within two to three days after the last tablet.
* Start taking your next pack of medication after the 7-day tablet-free days, even if you are still having menstrual bleeding.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget to take a dose, you must follow the steps below to ensure that the contraceptive effect is not reduced.

**Within 12 hours:**

Take the missed tablet as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet at your usual time.

* **Week 3 of the pack**:

Depending on whether you have taken your tablets correctly in the 7 days before the first missed tablet, you would have to follow the following options:

Your menses may not come until the second pack is finished, but there is no need to worry. However, if your menses do not occur after the next pack is finished, you should take a pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant.  **OR**  Stop taking medication from the current pack for 7 days (7-day tablet free period). A withdrawal bleed (menses) usually occurs and then start a new pack after 7 days. |
