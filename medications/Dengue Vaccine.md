Vaccine Information Leaflet

What is the Dengue Vaccine Used for?
------------------------------------

Dengue is spread by bites from an infected mosquito. Dengue is not contagious and does not spread directly from person to person.

Symptoms of dengue include fever, severe headache with pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, rashes, bleeding from the nose or gums, or easily bruised skin. A small number of people will have severe dengue disease, which is a medical emergency, as there may be signs of shock, severe bleeding, organ damage, or death.

Dengue vaccines help protect against dengue disease caused by four strains (serotypes 1,2,3,4) of the dengue virus. However, it does not fully protect all individuals against dengue infection, individuals should still continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites.
