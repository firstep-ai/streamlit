# Ustekinumab

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Ustekinumab belongs to a class of medicines called biologics. Biologics are genetically engineered proteins. Ustekinumab works by blocking the activity of proteins known as interleukin (IL) 12 and 23.

IL-12/23 levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. This medication helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the disease.

Ustekinumab does not work immediately and it may take several weeks before you notice any improvement in symptoms.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Ustekinumab should be taken as prescribed and you should not stop using the medication without discussing it with your doctor. Stopping Ustekinumab abruptly may cause the symptoms of your condition to return.

It may be taken alone, with methotrexate, or with other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Ustekinumab is available in a solution for injection that comes in a pre-filled form (ready-to-use). It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm or into the blood vessel (intravenous infusion). You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Ustekinumab yourself. You or your carer should receive training on how to inject the medication from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse prior to attempting administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site.

Your doctor will decide how much Ustekinumab you need and for how long.
