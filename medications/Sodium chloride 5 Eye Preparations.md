# Sodium chloride 5% Eye Preparations

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Sodium chloride 5% (also known as highly concentrated saline) eye preparations reduce/treat cornea swelling (edema). The cornea is the front, transparent part of the eye. When fluid builds up within the cornea, the swelling causes clouding of the cornea. This leads to blurry vision, and for some patients, they may also see halos around street lights or car headlights especially at night. Sodium chloride 5% helps to draw out fluid from the cornea to reduce swelling and relieve such symptoms.

Cornea swelling may occur due to surgery or in cornea disorders such as bullous keratopathy or Fuch’s dystrophy.

+ If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
