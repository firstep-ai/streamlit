# Selexipag

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Selexipag is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is also known as a selective prostacyclin (IP) agonist that lowers the pressure in the pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that transfer oxygen-poor blood from the heart and into the lungs ) by mimicking the effects of a natural substance, prostacyclin. In doing so, this medication relaxes and widens the pulmonary arteries. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries.

This medication is used to improve symptoms such as feeling breathless and increase your ability to exercise. It is also used to slow down the worsening of your condition.
