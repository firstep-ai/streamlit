# Anti-Nausea

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Anti-nausea medications or antiemetics are a group of medications that treat nausea and vomiting. Some of these medications work by speeding up the movement of food through the stomach and the digestive tract. Others work by blocking the chemical signal in your brain that causes the feeling of nausea and vomiting. The main factor influencing drug choice is the cause of nausea and vomiting.
