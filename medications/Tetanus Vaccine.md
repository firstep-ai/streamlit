# Tetanus Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

What the Tetanus Vaccine Used for?
----------------------------------

Tetanus vaccines help to prevent tetanus from recent cuts or wounds that have been contaminated with the bacteria, *Clostridium tetani*. Some examples of tetanus-prone wounds include those contaminated with dirt, faeces, soil and saliva, or a puncture wound (e.g. due to an animal bite).

Tetanus is a serious disease affecting the nerves. The tetanus bacteria produces a toxin that causes “lockjaw”, resulting in painful muscle contractions. This affects breathing and swallowing and can lead to death.
