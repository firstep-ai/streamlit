# Cyclosporin Eye Preparation

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Cyclosporin (also known as Ciclosporin or Cyclosporine) helps to control and to reduce our body’s overactive immune system. This reduces eye surface inflammation and increases tear production. Hence, cyclosporin is used in many eye conditions, such as severe dry eyes, allergic eye diseases, corneal healing, and uveitis (inflammation of middle layer of the eye).

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Proper use of eye drop

  + Wash your hands with soap and water and read the instructions on the label.
  + Tilt your head backwards and look up.
  + Shake the bottle.
  + Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
  + Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
  + If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
