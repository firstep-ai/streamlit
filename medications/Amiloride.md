Amiloride belongs to a class of medications called Diuretics. It works on your kidneys to get rid of extra water and salts in your body.

This medication is used to remove excess fluid from your body. This will decrease the pressure on the blood vessels and allow the heart to work less hard. Hence, it may also be used to treat high blood pressure.
