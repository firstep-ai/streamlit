# Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

What is the MMR Vaccine Used For?
---------------------------------

MMR vaccines help to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. MMR vaccines contain weakened live viruses, but are not able to cause measles, mumps or rubella in healthy people. 

Measles, mumps, and rubella are infectious diseases that spread easily from one person to another through the air and can lead to serious complications. 

Measles - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia (lung infection), seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.

Mumps - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility (not able to produce children). 

Rubella (German Measles) - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women) and mild fever. If a woman gets rubella during pregnancy, it may lead to miscarriage or birth defects in the newborn.
