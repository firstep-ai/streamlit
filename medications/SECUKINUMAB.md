# SECUKINUMAB

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Secukinumab belongs to a class of medicines called biologics. Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins. Secukinumab works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin (IL) 17A. IL-17A levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Secukinumab blocks IL-17A and helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the diseases.

It may be used alone or together with other DMARDs.
