Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Buprenorphine patches are used for the treatment of chronic (long-term) pain.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Apply your medication as prescribed by your healthcare professional.
* The patch should be worn all the time and changed every seven days unless advised otherwise by your healthcare professional.

  + Bathing, showering or swimming should not affect the patch. If a patch falls off, a new one should be applied.
* The patch should be applied to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side of the chest. Apply to a relatively hairless or nearly hairless, non-irritated unbroken skin site which should have no scars.

  + If the application site must be cleaned, it should be done with clean water only. Soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions or abrasive devices must not be used. The skin must be dry before the patch is applied.
  + Following removal of the protective layer, the transdermal patch should be pressed firmly in place with the palm of the hand for approximately 30 seconds, making sure the contact with skin is complete, especially around the edges. If the edges begin to peel off, the edges may be taped down with suitable surgical tape.
  + Avoid exposing the application site to external heat sources, such as heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, sauna, hot tubs, and heated water beds etc, as an increase in absorption of this medication may occur.
  + New patches should be applied to a different skin site. The same skin site should not be used for 3-4 weeks.
* If you find this medication does not sufficiently alleviate your pain at the prescribed dose, please consult your healthcare professional.
