What are some common side effects of this medication?
-----------------------------------------------------

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

The common side effects of Glibenclamide include:

* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

+ If you experience low blood sugar, read below to manage your symptoms

* Weight gain

+ Exercise regularly to prevent weight gain associated with this medication

Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Hunger
* Sweating
* Trembling
* Blurred vision
* Walking unsteadily
* Fast heartbeat

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately:

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

+ 3 glucose tablets or
+ Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
+ Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
+ 1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
+ 3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes.

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on.

Glibenclamide compared to other Sulphonylureas (eg. Glipizide or Gliclazide) has a longer drug action and higher risk for low blood sugar. You may want to discuss with your doctor to switch to a shorter action drug.

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).
