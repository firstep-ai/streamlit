# Topical Minoxidil

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

This medication is applied to the scalp to promote hair growth and slows down the balding process. It thickens hair strands and prolongs the growing phase of the hair.

The improvement rate varies from person to person. Hair growth is usually observed after the medicine has been used for at least 3 to 6 months and lasts only as long as the medicine is used. Hair loss may begin again within a few months after treatment is stopped.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Wash your hands before and after using this medication
* Apply Minoxidil lotion when the hair and scalp are clean and dry. Minoxidil foam may be applied when hair is damp.
* Apply 1ml of the medication to the affected areas on the scalp two times a day (morning and evening), or as directed by your doctor
* It is not necessary to shampoo your hair before applying this medication. However, if you do wash your hair, you may dry your hair with a hair dryer with cool setting after washing.
