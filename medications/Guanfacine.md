Guanfacine can be used to treat the symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), alongside the use of educational, social and psychological methods.

ADHD is associated with:

which may interfere with an individual’s ability to function in school, at work, or in social settings.

Guanfacine may be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Take your medication according to the instructions stated on the medication label.
* Guanfacine should be taken approximately at the same time each day.
* Do not stop taking or adjust the dose of this medication without checking with your doctor.
* The extended-release (ER) tablet should be swallowed whole with a small amount of water, milk or other liquids. Do not crush or chew the tablets, as this may increase the rate of Guanfacine release in the body.
* Do not change the brand of Guanfacine you are taking without informing your doctor.
