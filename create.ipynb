It works by preventing the virus from reproducing, and hence, reducing the amount of virus in your body. This increases the CD4 cell count in your body. CD4 cells are a type of immune cells that help your body fight off infections.\\xa0\\n\\nAbacavir is not a cure for HIV infection. It must be taken consistently every day to slow the progression of the disease.\\n\\nHow should I take or use this medication?\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n* Abacavir is always given in combination with other antiretroviral medication. Do not stop taking your medication without consulting checking with your healthcare professional.\\n* It is important to take the antiretroviral combination therapy exactly as prescribed every day.\\n* Do not miss any doses as this may make the medication less effective.\\n* You may take this medication with or without food.\\n\\nWhat should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nInform your healthcare professional if:\\xa0\\n\\n* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication\\n* You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding\\n* You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies\\n* You have heart problems, smoke or have a medical condition that increases your risk of heart disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes\\n\\nWhat are some common side effects of this medication?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n* Headache\\n  + Mild painkiller (Paracetamol) can be taken to reduce the pain\\n* Tiredness\\n* Nausea or vomiting\\n  + Try taking Abacavir with or after food\\n  + Avoid foods with high fat content\\xa0and eat small frequent meals\\n  + Try sucking on hard candy to reduce the nausea feeling\\n* Dreams/sleep disorders such as bad dreams\\n\\nInform your healthcare professional if these side effects persist or are intolerable.\\n\\nWhat are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAbacavir can cause a serious allergy reaction known as Abacavir-associated hypersensitivity reaction. This is characterised by:\\n\\n* Fever\\n* Rash\\n* Gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or stomach pain)\\n* Flu-like symptoms\\n* Extreme tiredness or achiness\\n* Shortness of breath\\n* Cough\\n* Sore throat\\n\\nIt can occur any time during the treatment with Abacavir but is more likely during the first 6 weeks of treatment initiation. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately. You are more likely to develop a hypersensitivity reaction to Abacavir if you have the HLA-B\\\\*5701 gene. If you have been tested positive for this gene, your physician will not commence you on Abacavir therapy.\\n\\nRarely, Abacavir can cause a build-up of acid in your blood (lactic acidosis). Consult your doctor if you experience signs of lactic acidosis such as:\\n\\n* Fast breathing or shortness of breath\\n* Fast or irregular heartbeat\\n* Dizziness or light-headedness\\n* Stomach discomfort\\n* Nausea or vomiting\\n* Extreme tiredness or weakness\\n* Muscle pain or cramps\\n\\nLiver problem can occur in people taking Abacavir. Consult your doctor if you experience signs of liver problem such as:\\n\\n* Yellowing of the skin and eye white\\n* Dark-coloured urine\\n* Light-coloured stools\\n* Loss of appetite\\n* Nausea\\n* Pain on the right side of the stomach\\n\\nA higher chance of heart attack was seen in people who took Abacavir. It is not known if this effect is caused by Abacavir. Seek medical consult immediately if you experience signs of heart attack such as:\\n\\n* Pressure or tightness of the chest\\n* Chest pain that radiates to the left arm, back or neck region\\n* Shortness of breath\\n* Cold sweat\\n* Nausea or vomiting\\n\\nWhat food or medication should I avoid when I take or use this medication?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNot applicable\\xa0\\n\\nHow should I store this medication?\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nStore in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children.\\xa0\\n\\nHow do I throw away this medication safely?\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nPack the medication into a bag and bring it back to the pharmacy where you received the medication from.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n----------\\n\\nPlease take note that the above is not a complete list of all possible side effects. If you have any concerns about your medication or if you have other side effects that you think are caused by this medication, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.\\n\\nIf you take more than the recommended dose, please seek medical advice immediately.
