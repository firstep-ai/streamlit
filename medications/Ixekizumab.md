# Ixekizumab

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Ixekizumab is a biologic medication which works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin (IL) 17A.

IL-17A levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This medication helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the diseases.

Ixekizumab does not work immediately and it may take several weeks before you notice any improvement in symptoms.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Ixekizumab should be used as prescribed and you should not stop using the medication without discussing it with your doctor. Stopping Ixekizumab suddenly may cause the symptoms of your condition to return.

It may be taken alone, with methotrexate, or with other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Ixekizumab is available in a solution for injection that comes in a pre-filled form (ready-to-use). It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm. You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Ixekizumab yourself. You or your carer should receive training on how to inject the medication from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse before attempting the administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site with each injection.

Your doctor will decide how much Ixekizumab you need and for how long it has to be taken.
