# Teriparatide

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

* Teriparatide is used to treat osteoporosis (bone loss) and for those who are at high risk of fracture. It is a drug that is similar to our body's parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is important in maintaining healthy bones. Teriparatide stimulates new bone formation and increases bone strength, thereby reducing the risk of a fracture.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Teriparatide is given by injection (from a pre-filled pen).
* Teriparatide is given by injection under the subcutaneous layer (fatty layer of the skin) into the thigh or abdomen.
* For the first few doses, take the injection when sitting or lying down, as some  may experience dizziness after using teriparatide. This usually happens within 4 hours after administering teriparatide and goes away within a few hours.
* Inspect the injection visually before using. Teriparatide is a clear and colourless liquid. Do not use if solid particles appear or if the solution is cloudy or coloured
* Patients who administer teriparatide should receive appropriate training and instructions on the proper use of the device from a qualified healthcare professional.
* The pre-filled pen should never be shared with others (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection.
