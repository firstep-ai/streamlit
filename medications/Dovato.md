# Dovato

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Dovato is a medication that contains two different types of anti-virals namely: Dolutegravir and Lamivudine, in a single tablet. These two anti-virals work in different ways against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by blocking the reproduction of the virus. You may be given Dovato alone or together with another anti-viral medication for treatment of HIV. Taking this medication regularly will reduce the level of HIV in your body which in turn protects your immune system and reduces the risk of spreading HIV infection.
