# Zolmitriptan

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist. It works by reducing inflammation and reversing the widening of blood vessels in the brain, thereby stopping a migraine headache. It is often used to treat a migraine attack after it begins. It will not prevent a migraine.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions as to how many tablets to take when the attack starts. It should work within 1 hour.
* If your migraine improves but comes back, wait at least 2 hours before taking the next dose. Do not take more than (4 tablets) 10mg per day.
* However, if you are taking a medication called cimetidine (for indigestion or stomach ulcers), the maximum dose per day is (2 tablets) 5mg.
* Do not use zolmitriptan too frequently (limit of 10 days use per month), as it may cause medication overuse headache (migraine/headache may worsen).
* Zomig Rapimelt is designed to dissolve on the tongue rather than be swallowed. Peel open the foil packaging and gently remove a tablet. Do not push the tablet through the foil. Place it on your tongue and allow it to dissolve before you swallow.

* If the tablets did not give you enough help with your migraine, consult your doctor.
