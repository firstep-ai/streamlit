# Atropine Eye Drop (for Non-Myopia Users)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Atropine belongs to a class of medications called mydriatics, which dilate the pupil to make it bigger. It is also a cycloplegic agent (medication that relaxes the eye muscles which help the eye to focus).

Doctors may prescribe atropine eye drop to children before a spectacle degree test (refraction test). Atropine will dilate your child’s eyes so that the spectacle degree test is most accurate.

Atropine may also be used to relieve pain caused by eye inflammation. Hence, it is used often in post-surgery cases or in uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye).

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Proper use of eye drop

  + Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
  + Tilt your head backwards and look up.
  + Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
  + Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
  + If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
  + If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first
