What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Sildenafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction, a condition where you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse. It works by relaxing the blood vessels in your penis, allowing blood to flow into your penis when you get sexually excited. This medicine will only help you to get an erection if you are sexually stimulated. Therefore it is taken on an as-needed basis.

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medicine.

-----------------------------------------

* It usually starts to work within 1 hour and effective up to 4 hours before sexual activity.
* This medication should be taken before food, on an empty stomach. You may find that this medicine takes longer to start working if you take it with a high-fat meal (such as cheeseburger and french fries).

If you are not certain, ask your healthcare professional.
* You are taking medicines called Alpha-1 Blockers (such as Tamsulosin, Terazosin, Prazosin, Alfuzosin), as the combination may further lower your blood pressure.
