# Naltrexone

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Naltrexone is used to help people stay off heroin or other opioids after having been weaned off from them.

It can also be used to help you reduce the desire to drink alcohol.

Naltrexone may be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Naltrexone should be taken with or after food.
* Take your medication according to the instructions stated on the medication label.
* Do not stop taking or adjust the dose of this medication without checking with your doctor.
* Do check with your doctor on how long you will have to be on this medication.

**Do not give your tablets to people who are dependent on opioids as they could cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. If this happens, call 995 at once.**

**IMPORTANT: Do not take Naltrexone if you have taken heroin or other opioids in the past 7-10 days.**

Doing so may result in unpleasant, and sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms within minutes of taking naltrexone. Withdrawal symptoms include:

* Stuffy or runny nose
* Teary eyes
* Tiredness
* Sweating
* Anxiety
* Tremors
* Nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps
* Bone pain or muscle aches
* Diarrhoea

Be sure that your family or caregiver are also aware of the above symptoms so they can call your doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

* If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if more than half of the time to the next dose has passed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your usual timing.
* For example, for a medication to be taken two times daily at 8am and 8pm, and you missed your first dose at 8am, skip the first dose if it is after 2pm, and take your second dose at the usual timing at 8pm. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
* **Do not take heroin or other opioids once you have stopped or skipped your dose. Naltrexone blocks the “high” feeling you get from heroin and other opioids. Do not try to overcome the effect of Naltrexone by using higher doses of heroin or other opioids, as this can result in breathing difficulties and even death from overdose.**
