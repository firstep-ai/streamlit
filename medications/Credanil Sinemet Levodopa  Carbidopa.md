What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Credanil/ Sinemet contains two medications: Levodopa and carbidopa.

This medication is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. This medication helps to improve muscle control and allows more normal body movements.
