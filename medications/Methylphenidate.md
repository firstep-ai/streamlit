# Methylphenidate

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Methylphenidate is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It works by stimulating the brain to increase attention, concentration, reduce impulsive and hyperactive behaviour and manage certain sleep disorders.

Methylphenidate is available as an immediate-release preparation or modified-release preparations.

The immediate-release preparation releases the medication relatively quickly in the body and the effects gradually wear-off over a few hours.

Modified-release preparations mean that the medication is released slowly during the day, for a longer duration of effects. These preparations have the letters ‘LA’ (long-acting), ‘SR’ (sustained-release), ‘MR’ (modified-release) or ‘ER’(extended-release) after the brand name, and may differ in their duration of effects.

* Methylphenidate  Tablet (Ritalin®, Rubifen®)
* Methylphenidate LA Capsule (Ritalin® LA)
* Methylphenidate SR Capsule (Ritalin® SR)
* Methylphenidate MR Capsule (Medikinet® MR)
* Methylphenidate ER Tablet (Concerta® ER)

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* Most methylphenidate preparations can be taken with or without food, except for Medikinet® MR. Medikinet® MR should be taken with or after food as it may affect the absorption of the medication into the body.
* For immediate-release preparations, do not take it too late in the evening as it may cause trouble sleeping.
* If you are taking the modified-release preparations, the capsules/tablets must not be crushed or chewed. For **Ritalin® LA** and **Medikinet® MR**, the capsules may be opened and the contents sprinkled onto a small amount (tablespoon) of room temperature or cold food (e.g. applesauce, yoghurt). It must be taken immediately and not stored for future use.
* Your doctor would start the medication at a low dose, and then slowly adjust the dose according to your response to the medication.
* For **Concerta® ER** , the tablet does not dissolve completely after all of the medication has been released and sometimes the tablet shell may appear in your stools. This is normal.
