# Corticosteroids Eye Preparations

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Corticosteroids eye preparations act in the same way as steroid hormones produced within our body. They reduce eye inflammation and reduce symptoms of swelling, redness, and itchiness in the eyes.

These medications are used to treat various conditions such as severe dry eyes, allergic eye conditions, thyroid eye disease, and inflammatory eye conditions. They may also be used to prevent rejection after cornea transplants and to reduce inflammation after eye surgeries.

Corticosteroids eye preparations may come in eye drop, eye suspension or eye ointment formulations.

* If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
* If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first.
* For contact lens wearers
  + It may not be advisable to wear contact lenses for certain eye conditions during treatment. Check with your healthcare professional if you need to wear contact lenses.
* Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
