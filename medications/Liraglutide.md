What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Liraglutide is used to control diabetes. It works by reducing your food craving and increasing the insulin made by your body in response to the food that you eat. It can also be used to help with weight management in certain individuals.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Liraglutide should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer of the skin on your upper arms, thighs or tummy (abdomen). It should not be injected into the veins or into the muscles. Inject the dose told by your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. Read the product information leaflet on how to inject this medication.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget a dose, use the injection as soon as you remember. However, if it is more than 12 hours since you should have injected this medication, skip the missed dose. Then inject the next dose as usual the following day.
