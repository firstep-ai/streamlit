--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

  + Pregnancy: Tell your doctor immediately if you think you are pregnant. You should discuss with your doctor to check if Bromocriptine should be continued during pregnancy.
  + Female patients who are not planning to be pregnant should use non-hormonal methods eg barrier contraception to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal medications used to prevent pregnancy might decrease the effectiveness of Bromocriptine.
  + Breast-feeding: Bromocriptine stops the production of milk. However, if you still continue to produce milk, you should not breast-feed your child.

Do not stop taking Bromocriptine suddenly as this may cause unwanted effects.
