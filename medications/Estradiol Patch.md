# Estradiol Patch

Estradiol patch is a type of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Learn how to use the medication, side effects, special precautions, and more.

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Estradiol patch is a type of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). It contains a female hormone, estrogen. It is used to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flushes (feeling a sudden warmth of the face, neck and chest with the skin turning red), excessive sweating, vaginal dryness and bone loss. These symptoms are typically caused by a decrease in the levels of estrogen in the body, which happens naturally after menopause. Estradiol patch works by replacing the estrogen in the body.

Using estrogen alone may cause thickening of the uterus (womb) lining. For women who have an intact uterus, they will require an additional female hormone, progesterone, to prevent this. If your doctor prescribes progestogen for a specific duration (usually 10-14 days) each month, you will experience a withdrawal bleed (menses) after finishing the progestogen capsules/tablets.

How should I take or use this medication?

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
