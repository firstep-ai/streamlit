What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Tetracyclines is a class of antibiotics that is used to treat or prevent infections caused by certain bacteria.

They are also used for the treatment of acne by suppressing the growth of the acne bacteria and decreasing the inflammation caused by the bacteria.

Examples of tetracyclines include:

* Doxycycline
* Minocycline
* Tetracycline

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Doxycycline or Minocycline: Take with or after food.
* Tetracycline: Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after food for better absorption. However, if it upsets your stomach, you can take it with some food.
* Take these medications with a glass of water to prevent irritation of the oesophagus (gullet).
* Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after ingestion.
* Complete the course of antibiotics even if you feel better as incomplete treatment might cause the infection to return or cause antibiotic resistance. When antibiotic resistance happens, the antibiotic will not be able to control the growth of the bacteria anymore. Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
