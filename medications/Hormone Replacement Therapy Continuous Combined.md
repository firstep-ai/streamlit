What is this medication for?
----------------------------

There are many types of different HRT. This leaflet addresses the use of continuous combined HRT (e.g. Activelle®, Femoston® 1/5) which contains estrogen and progestogen combined in a tablet, in one pack.  These two female hormones, estrogen and progestogen given together to relieve bothersome symptoms of menopause.

If you still have a womb and have not had a period for a year (post-menopause) you can usually take continuous combined HRT.

Symptoms of menopause include hot face, neck and chest (“hot flushes”), night sweats, vaginal dryness and low mood. The decrease in estrogen may also lead to a condition called osteoporosis, where the bones become thinner, weaker and easier to break. Using estrogen alone may cause abnormal thickening of the uterus (womb) lining – hence those with an intact uterus require an additional female hormone, progestogen, to prevent this.
