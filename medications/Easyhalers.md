# Easyhalers

Medication Information Leaflet

​What are Easyhalers?
---------------------

* Easyhalers are inhaler devices that help deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
* They are used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.

Why is it important to use Easyhalers correctly?
------------------------------------------------

* Easyhalers deliver a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
* Hence, it is important to use the Easyhaler correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
* This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps reduce any side effects.

How do Easyhalers work?
-----------------------

Each Easyhaler consists of a plastic device that contains dry powdered medication. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Easyhaler automatically releases the medication.
