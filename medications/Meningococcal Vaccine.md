# Meningococcal Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

What the Meningococcal Vaccine Used for?
----------------------------------------

Meningococcal vaccines help protect against meningococcal disease caused by four strains (A, C, Y, W-135) of the bacteria *Neisseria meningitidis*. Meningococcal disease can present as an infection of the brain and spinal cord lining (meningitis), infection of the blood (septicaemia) or lung infection (pneumonia).

Symptoms of meningococcal disease may include a sudden onset of headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, neck stiffness, a rash of red-purple spots or bruises. Young children may present with less specific symptoms such as irritability, crying, difficulty in waking or refusal to eat.

Meningococcal disease is spread through direct person-to-person contact (e.g. through saliva during kissing) or when in close and prolonged contact with an infected person through the air (e.g. coughing or sneezing). A person who is well but a carrier of the bacteria in their body, may also spread the disease.

While the risk of meningococcal disease is rare in most countries, it is a severe disease with a significant risk of death or lasting disabilities in people who get it.
