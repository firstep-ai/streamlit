# Folic Acid (Folate)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Folic acid (or folate) is a type of vitamin naturally found in some foods that helps the body to produce red blood cells. A lack of folic acid may result in folate-deficiency anemia, a condition in which there is insufficient healthy red blood cells to provide oxygen to the body.

During pregnancy, folic acid supplementation may reduce the incidence of birth defects (e.g. abnormal development of brain and spinal cord in the baby).

Folic acid supplementation may be required in those with certain conditions (e.g. kidney disease, excessive alcohol intake) or taking certain medications (e.g. Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine).
