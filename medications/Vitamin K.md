# Vitamin K

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Vitamin K is used to treat or prevent Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is needed for normal clotting of blood and a deficiency in Vitamin K can increase the risk of bleeding in the body.

Babies at birth have a small store of Vitamin K in their bodies, which is quickly used up in the first few days of life. A Vitamin K supplement may be given to prevent ‘Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB)’. VKDB can cause blood loss from the umbilical cord site, nose, mouth or brain of the baby.

Vitamin K supplement may also be given to those who have a Vitamin K deficiency due to liver or gut disease, or the long term use of some medications, such as certain antibiotics.

In addition, Vitamin K may also be used to prevent or reverse the side effects of bleeding associated with an overdose of blood thinners (e.g. warfarin).
