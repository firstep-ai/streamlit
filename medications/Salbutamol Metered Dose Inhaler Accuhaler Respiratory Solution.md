What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Salbutamol is used to relieve breathlessness in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Salbutamol helps to open up the airway quickly, making it easier for one to breathe. Salbutamol helps to relieve breathlessness quickly and is normally referred to as a ‘reliever’ inhaler. It does not prevent attacks from happening.
