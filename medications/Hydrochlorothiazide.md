What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very rarely, this medication may be linked to the increased risk of Non-melanoma skin cancer. Overseas studies involving Caucasians (fair skin) have shown that taking higher doses of this medication for long periods of time is linked to a very small risk of this skin cancer. The results of these studies cannot be directly applied to most of the Singaporean population as the skin types are very different. The risk of this skin cancer caused by this medication is likely to be lower in the local population

* Inform your doctor immediately if you notice any new, abnormal skin lesions or unusual lumps or patches on your skin that do not heal or go away after a few weeks.
* Avoid standing under midday sun (11am to 4pm) and seek shade whenever possible

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.
