# Gemfibrozil

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Gemfibrozil belongs to the class of medications called fibrates. Fibrates work by speeding the natural processes that remove cholesterol from the body. They lower the amount of ‘fat’ (triglyceride) and ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol) in the blood.

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, fibrates may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your cholesterol level may rise again.
* This medicine should be taken before food, on an empty stomach.
* If you are taking cholestyramine or colestipol, take it 4 to 6 hours before or 1 hour after gemfibrozil.
