What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Hydroxychloroquine is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases like discoid & systemic lupus erythematosus (DLE & SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and cutaneous vasculitis.

It is believed to disrupt the communication of various cells in the immune system and is particularly effective in treating skin and joint symptoms. It can be used alone or in combination with other medications such as Azathioprine, Methotrexate and Mycophenolate mofetil.
