# Riociguat

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Riociguat is used to treat high blood pressure in the lungs, known as pulmonary hypertension. More specifically, it can help treat a subgroup of pulmonary hypertension patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

Riociguat is a type of medication called a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator. It works by widening the pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that send blood from the heart to the lungs to receive oxygen), making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the lungs. This should improve symptoms such as breathlessness and increase your ability to exercise.
