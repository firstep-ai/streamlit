What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Calcipotriol (also known as calcipotriene) is used to treat psoriasis, an inflammatory condition of the skin with increased turnover of skin cells, creating red, scaly patches of skin.  The medication works by slowing down cell growth in the skin. The addition of betamethasone in the medication helps to reduce the signs of inflammation (such as redness, swelling) at the same time.

This medication may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.
