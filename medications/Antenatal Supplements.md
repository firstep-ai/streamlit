​This leaflet describes some of the common supplements prescribed by your healthcare professional during your pregnancy.

| **Folic Acid**  *(usually taken from preconception till the 12th week of pregnancy)* | |
| **What is this for​** | ​To reduce the risk of birth defects, e.g. abnormal development of the spinal cord in the baby during the early stages of pregnancy. |
| **​How to take** | Take one tablet once a day, usually in the morning, with or without food. |
| **​Side effects** | Generally, well tolerated without any significant side effects. |

| **Prenatal multivitamins (E.g. Obimin / Prenaforte / Ganilia)**  *(usually taken from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards until delivery)* | |
| **What is this for​** | Most prenatal vitamins contain a higher content of micronutrients to meet the increased demand during pregnancy. For example, most prenatal vitamins will contain iron, calcium and folic acid to meet the needs of the baby and mother. Iron helps with the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the baby. Calcium will help strengthen the baby’s bone development.    Not all multivitamins are safe in pregnancy as they may contain higher than necessary contents e.g. some multivitamins may contain higher doses of Vitamin A that may not be safe in pregnancy. Check with your healthcare professional before buying any multivitamins on your own. |
| **​How to take** | Dose is usually one tablet/capsule after breakfast or lunch.  Follow the instructions stated on the medication label / packaging. |
| **​Side effects** | Generally well tolerated in most patients. Some patients may experience  ● Dark-coloured stools – due to the iron content. This is harmless.  ● Constipation (due to the calcium and iron contents). You can drink more water and take plenty of fruits and vegetables to prevent it.  Alertness if taken close to bedtime as it contains Vitamin B. |
| **​Other considerations** | For supplements containing iron, space at least 2 hours apart from coffee, tea, milk, dairy products, and calcium supplements for better absorption.  Some preparations may contain fish oil (e.g. Ganilia), hence, additional fish oil supplementation is not required. |
