Once reconstituted, the oral suspension should only be administered using the oral syringe supplied with each pack as below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Shake the closed bottle of the reconstituted suspension for approximately 10 seconds before each use. Remove the cap. |  |
| 2 | While the bottle is upright, on a flat surface, insert the tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor. |  |
| 3 | Turn the bottle upside down while holding the oral syringe in place. Slowly pull back the plunger of the oral syringe to the graduation mark that marks the dose for you. To measure the dose accurately, the top edge of the black ring should be lined up with the graduated mark on the oral syringe. |  |
| 4 | If large bubbles can be seen, slowly push the plunger back into the syringe. This will force the medicine back into the bottle. Repeat step 3. |
| 5 | Turn the bottle back upright with the oral syringe still in place. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle. |  |
| 6 | Put the tip of the oral syringe into the mouth.  Point the tip of the oral syringe towards the inside of the cheek. SLOWLY push down the plunger of the oral syringe.  Do not squirt the medicine out quickly. |  |
| 7 | Replace the cap on the bottle, leaving the bottle adaptor in place.  The syringe should be washed after each dose.   * Pull the plunger out of the syringe and wash both parts in warm soapy water. Then rinse with water. * Dry the two parts. Push the plunger back into the syringe.   Keep it in a clean, safe place with the medicine. | |
