What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Topical estrogen (Oestrogel®)is a type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that contains a female hormone, estrogen. It is applied onto the skin. It is used to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flushes, excessive sweating, vaginal dryness and bone loss. These symptoms are typically caused by a decrease in the levels of estrogen in the body, which happens naturally after menopause. Topical estrogen works by replacing the estrogen in the body.

Using estrogen alone may cause unusual thickening of the uterus (womb) lining. Hence women who have an intact uterus will require an additional female hormone, progestogen, to prevent this. If your doctor prescribes progestogen to be taken for a specific duration (usually 10 – 14 days) each month, you will experience a withdrawal bleed (menses) after finishing the progestogen capsules/tablets.
