# Salmeterol and Fluticasone Inhaler

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Seretide inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.

Seretide contains two ingredients, Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Salmeterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Fluticasone is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways.

Seretide is normally referred to as a ‘preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Use your Seretide inhaler every day to control your condition.
* Do not stop using your inhaler even when you feel well or do not have any symptoms.
* Please refer to the Seretide Accuhaler’s or Evohaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
* You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
* You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies
* You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.
* You have high blood pressure
* You have heart, liver or thyroid problems
* You have diabetes
* You have low blood potassium levels

Seretide will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:

* Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
* Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
* Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

+ Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing.

The dizziness and headache may happen but should get better over time. Check with your doctor if any of these symptoms are serious or do not go away.
