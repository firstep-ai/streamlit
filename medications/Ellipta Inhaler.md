# Ellipta Inhaler

Medication Information Leaflet

​What is Ellipta?
-----------------

* Ellipta is an inhaler device that helps deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
* It is used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.

Why is it important to use an Ellipta correctly?
------------------------------------------------

* Ellipta delivers a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
* Hence, it is important to use the Ellipta correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
* This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps reduce any side effects.

How does an Ellipta work?
-------------------------

Each Ellipta consists of a plastic device with blister strips containing a dry powdered medication. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Ellipta automatically releases the medication.
