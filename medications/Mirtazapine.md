How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Mirtazapine may be taken with or without food.
* Mirtazapine is available as orodispersible tablets. This means that these tablets dissolve when you put them in your mouth and can be swallowed without water.
* To remove the orodispersible tablets from the blister strip:
  1. Dry your hands. The tablets will dissolve if your hands are wet.
  2. Follow the dotted lines on the strip and cut out a square containing a tablet
  3. On the back of the square, there are black arrows printed on certain corners. Carefully peel off the foil, starting from the corner indicated by the black arrow.
  4. Place the tablet on your tongue. You may take it with or without water. **Take the tablet as soon as possible** once the foil has been peeled open.
* Take your medication according to the instructions stated on the medication label.
* Do not stop taking or adjust the dose of this medication without checking with your doctor.

------------------------------------------------------------

* If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if more than half of the time to the next dose has passed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your usual timing.
* For example, for a medication to be taken two times daily at 8am and 8pm, and you missed your first dose at 8am, skip the first dose if it is after 2pm, and take your second dose at the usual timing at 8pm. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
