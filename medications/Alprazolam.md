What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Alprazolam belongs to a class of medications known as benzodiazepines.

It can be used for treatment of anxiety or panic symptoms such as: 

* Feeling constantly worried and helpless
* Very fast heartbeat
* Uncontrolled shaking of body parts such as hands (tremors)
* Sweating
* Nervousness

It may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Follow the instructions on your medication label and take this medication as prescribed by your doctor.
* This medication may be taken with or without food.
* If you feel that the medication is not working well, please consult your doctor.
* You should obtain this medication from the same doctor or clinic whenever possible.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

* If you are directed by your doctor to take the medication regularly but forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if more than half of the time to the next dose has passed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your usual timing.
* For example, for a medication to be taken two times daily at 8am and 8pm, and you missed your first dose at 8am, skip the first dose if it is after 2pm, and take your second dose at the usual timing at 8pm. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
* You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. If you are pregnant and/or breastfeeding, your doctor would have discussed the potential benefits and side-effects with you and should you have further questions or concerns, do consult your doctor.
* You are taking any other medications (including those that can be bought without a prescription), supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies. Some of them may affect how this medication works or cause serious drug interactions.
* You have or have ever had:
  + Other drug allergies
  + Other mental health conditions such as depression (low mood)
  + Medical conditions such as:
    - Lung, brain, kidney or liver disease
    - Previous drug or alcohol abuse
    - Glaucoma (high pressure in the eyes), seizures (fits), Myasthenia Gravis (an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles) or sleep apnea (temporary stopping of breathing during sleep)

**This medication may be habit-forming when taken excessively or for a prolonged duration** (especially at high doses). This may result in:

* Unintentional, regular use of the medication
* Dependence or over-reliance on the medication
* Decreased effectiveness of the medication

      This can be prevented by taking the medication:

* On a short-term basis (2 - 4 weeks)
* At the lowest effective dose
* Intermittently (for example, taking it once every 2 or 3 nights for the relief of sleep difficulty)

If you have been taking the medication on a long-term basis or at high doses, do not stop taking it abruptly as it may lead to withdrawal symptoms such as increased sweating, increased heart rate, tremors, trouble sleeping, increased agitation, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that do not exist), increased anxiety, nausea or vomiting, and in severe cases, medical emergencies such as fits.

If you wish to cut down, discuss with your doctor to come up with a plan to help you on this. It is often best to reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks.

If you are prescribed this medication for other conditions, consult your doctor or specialist for further advice about the appropriate dose and duration.
