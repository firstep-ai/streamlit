What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a group of medications used to treat pain and to reduce inflammation. NSAIDs eye drops are commonly used in inflammatory eye conditions. They are given before and/or after eye surgeries to prevent or to reduce inflammation and swelling. They can also be given in allergic eye conditions for temporary itch relief.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Proper use of eye drop

  + Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
  + Shake the bottle.
  + Tilt your head backwards and look up.
  + Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
  + Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed.
  + If you need to use more than 1 drop of medicine, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medicine from being washed away by the second drop of medicine before it has time to work. This also prevents any medicine interactions between different eye drops.
