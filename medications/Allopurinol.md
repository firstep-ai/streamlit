# Allopurinol

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Allopurinol is used to prevent gout, a condition that can cause pain and swelling in the joints. 

Gout happens when there is too much uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a chemical that is produced when the body breaks down certain food.  Allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thus lowering the uric acid levels in the body.

Allopurinol is also used in the treatment of uric acid stones and to prevent uric acid levels from going up too high during chemotherapy.

The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

Allopurinol is generally safe, but very rarely, a bad skin reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TENs) or Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systematic symptoms (DRESS) may happen. This can cause serious health problems that may sometimes be fatal. Your doctor may conduct a gene testing before starting this medication as individuals with a specific gene type (HLA-B\*5801) or poor kidney function may be more likely to suffer serious skin reactions.

Stop this medication and see a doctor immediately if you have the following signs within three months of starting this medication. These symptoms may occur separately and may not occur all at the same time:

* Painful rash which can spread to a bigger area and start to blister

In rare instances, this medication may also cause injury to the liver. Stop this medication and see a doctor immediately if you notice any dark-coloured urine, light coloured stools, yellowing of the skin or eyes.
