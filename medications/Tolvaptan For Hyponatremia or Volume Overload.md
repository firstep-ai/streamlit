# Tolvaptan (For Hyponatremia or Volume Overload)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

This medication is used to treat hyponatremia, where the sodium level in the blood is below normal. Hyponatremia may occur in patients with heart failure or ‘Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion’ (SIADH), which is a condition where the body retains too much water. Excessively low sodium levels may result in difficulties in concentration and memory, or in maintaining your balance. In serious cases, brain swelling and seizures might occur.

Tolvaptan may also be used with other medications, such as a diuretic (a medication which helps to remove excess water and salt from the body), to reduce the amount of water in your body.

Tolvaptan works by blocking vasopressin, a hormone that reduces water loss from the body. With increased urine production, excess water is removed and sodium levels in the blood will increase.

-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional
