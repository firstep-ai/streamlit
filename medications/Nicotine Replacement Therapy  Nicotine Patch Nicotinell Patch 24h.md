# Nicotine Replacement Therapy – Nicotine Patch (Nicotinell® Patch 24h)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the other harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when you are trying to quit smoking, allowing you to focus on the other aspects in your effort to quit smoking.

Nicotinell® Patch releases nicotine slowly over 24 hours, which is absorbed into your bloodstream. This provides your body with nicotine to control baseline nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

Apply a new patch at the same time every day. Remove the backing of the patch and apply onto any hairless, clean and dry area of your chest, back, upper arm, thigh or hip. Hold down for 10 seconds and run your finger around the edges of the patch to ensure proper adhesion.

Remove the previous patch before applying a new patch. Fold the used patch into half with the sticky sides together and throw it away.

Apply the patch to a different site each day to reduce skin irritation. After 2 to 3 days, you may apply to a previous spot if there is no sign of irritation. Do not apply patch onto broken skin, red or irritated areas.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you miss a dose, apply it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and apply the patch at your usual time. Do not apply two patches to make up for the missed dose.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You should stop smoking once you start to use NRT. Smoking and using NRT at the same time may increase the risk of adverse effects from the additive effects of nicotine in your body.

If you continue to feel the urge to smoke or experience severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms even after using the NRT patch, please inform your healthcare professional as you may need other types of NRT.
