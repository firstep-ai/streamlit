Important Information
---------------------

* Read the label on the tube carefully before using the eye ointment.
* Using a mirror may make the application of eye ointment easier.
* Record the date opened on the tube of eye ointment. Throw it away immediately once contaminated or after reaching its in-use shelf life as recommended by the manufacturer.
* If you need to apply both the eye drop and ointment, you should apply the eye drop first. Wait for at least 5 minutes before applying the eye ointment.
* If you need to apply more than one eye ointment, wait for at least 10 minutes before applying the next eye ointment.
* Applying eye ointments may cause your vision to become blurry for a short period of time. You should avoid driving, operating machinery, or doing things in places with poor lighting until your vision clears.

For Contact Lens Wearers
------------------------

* Remove your contact lens before applying the ointment. You can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye ointment.
* Contact lens wearers who are advised by a doctor NOT to wear contact lenses should strictly follow the doctorâ€™s advice.
