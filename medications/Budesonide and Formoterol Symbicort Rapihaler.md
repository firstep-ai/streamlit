# Budesonide and Formoterol (Symbicort) Rapihaler

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Symbicort inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.

Symbicort contains two ingredients, Formoterol and Budesonide. Formoterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Budesonide is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways.

Symbicort is normally referred to as a ’preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack. In some cases, the doctor will also ask you to use Symbicort to relieve asthma attacks.

What precautions should I take when taking or using this medication?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Inform your healthcare professional if:

* You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication

Symbicort can be used both to prevent and relieve an asthma attack. If your doctor has told you to use Symbicort to relieve your asthma attack, make sure you have it with you at all times.

However, if your doctor gave you a separate fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, make sure you have the Salbutamol inhaler with you at all times instead. A fast-acting inhaler would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:

* Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
* Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness

  gets worse
* Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

What are some common side effects of this medication?
-----------------------------------------------------

* Increase chance of experiencing throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white

  patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing. You can prevent these side

  effects by:

+ Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing
+ Brushing your teeth each time after you use your Symbicort inhaler
