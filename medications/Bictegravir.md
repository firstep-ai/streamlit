# Bictegravir

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Bictegravir (available only as a fixed-dose combination tablet with Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Alafenamide) is an antiretroviral medication that is used to treat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It works by preventing the virus from replicating (reproducing), and hence, reducing the amount of viruses (viral load) in your body. This increases the CD4 cell count in your body. CD4 cells are a type of immune cells that help your body fight off infections. However, Bictegravir is not a cure for HIV infection. It must be taken consistently every day to slow the progression of the disease. It is usually given in combination with other anti-retroviral medications (combination therapy).
