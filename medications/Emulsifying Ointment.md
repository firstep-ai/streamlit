Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

It is used as a moisturiser or soap substitute for washing (other soaps may dry out the skin). It leaves a thin film of ointment on the skin to prevent water loss.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

If your doctor has prescribed this for you as a:

* **Moisturiser:**

Apply or massage gently in a downward direction (in the direction of hair growth) to the affected areas at least 2 times a day or as instructed by your doctor. A good time to apply the ointment is within 5 to 10 minutes after your bath, while your skin is still moist. This helps to seal in the moisture more effectively and prevents your skin from losing too much water.

* **Bar soap substitute:**

Wet the body. Rub some emulsifying ointment with water between your palms until it lathers, then apply it to the entire body in a downward direction (in the direction of hair growth). Avoid use on your face and scalp, unless directed by your doctor. Wash off with water and gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel.

* **Liquid soap substitute:**

Scoop a spoonful into a container. Add some hot tap water and stir until the ointment melts and is well mixed. Add some cold tap water to cool it. Apply to the entire body, except your face and scalp. Wash off with water and gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel.
