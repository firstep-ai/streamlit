What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Aciclovir cream is used for the treatment of mild herpes simplex infections of the lips (cold sores) and the skin.

Aciclovir works by stopping the growth of the *Herpes simplex* virus (HSV) that causes cold sores. While aciclovir cream does not prevent cold sores from coming back, it can reduce the severity and duration of the cold sore symptoms when they appear.

Symptoms of cold sores often include itching, burning or tingling before blisters appear. The blisters may merge and burst before crusting over. The HSV is able to infect other parts of the body or can spread to others, via direct contact with the cold sores or contaminated items (e.g. towels, eating and drinking utensils). The HSV can also be sexually transmitted.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Wash and dry hands before and after use to prevent the spread of infection
* Apply aciclovir cream on the blisters. It is best to apply when the first signs of a cold sore appear (e.g. itching, tingling)
* Apply a thin layer to the affected areas 5 times a day, approximately every 4 hours. You do not need to apply the cream when you are asleep
* Continue application for at least 5 days, or up to 10 days if the cold sores have not healed
* For cold sores on the lips, apply aciclovir cream after eating or drinking to minimize accidental swallowing of the medication

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
