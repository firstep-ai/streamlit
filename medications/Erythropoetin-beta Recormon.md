| How to prepare the injection | Wash your hands thoroughly. |
| Peel back the paper strip and remove the needle and syringe from the packaging.  Check that the solution is clear, colourless and does not contain particles or clumps. |
| Peel off the protective seal from the needle cap. Do not remove the needle from the cap yet.  Hold the syringe and remove the grey rubber protection cap by gently twisting and pulling.  Attach the needle with the needle cap firmly onto the syringe. |
| Expel air bubbles from the syringe and needle by holding the syringe vertically and gently tapping the syringe barrel with your fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. Then, slowly push the plunger upwards to expel the air bubbles. |
| Wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab to disinfect the area. Leave it to dry for around 10 seconds. Do not discard the alcohol swab as it can be used later. Possible sites of injection include the stomach, thigh, upper arms or buttocks. Do not inject into the skin that is irritated, bruised, scarred, moles or has stretch marks. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small dent or lump in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects into the same spot). |
| How to inject the medication | Remove the plastic needle cap.  Use your thumb and index finger to create a skin fold at the site of injection. |
| Insert the needle into the skin fold at a right angle. Once the needle is inserted, release the skin fold and press down the plunger slowly until all the solution has been injected. |
| When the injection is completed, remove the needle and place the alcohol swab over injection site. Apply light pressure on the site for a few seconds. Do not rub or massage the injection site. |
| How to discard | Replace the needle cap and discard the entire syringe with the used needle in a puncture proof container, such as a plastic bottle with cap or cover. |
