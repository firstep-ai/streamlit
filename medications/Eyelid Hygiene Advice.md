Maintaining good eyelid hygiene helps to control the symptoms and severity of inflammation of the eyelids and dry eyes. Thorough eyelid cleansing will help remove debris, crust and discharges from the lid margin. You can relieve the irritation by following the steps below:

|  |  |

| **​Instructions** | ​**Pictures** |
| ​1. Wash your hands with soap and water. | ​ |
| ​2. Fold the cotton linen into a small rectangle. | ​ |
| ​​3. Apply a small amount of eyelid cleanser on the cotton linen. | ​ |
| ​4. Close your eyes gently. Eyelid margins will not be prominent if you squeeze your eyes. | ​ |
| 5. Upper eyelid: Use your finger to gently lift the upper eyelid so that the margin is visible. Holding a cotton linen in another hand, scrub several times along the eyelid margin where the eye lash meets the skin. | ​ |
| ​6. Lower eyelid: Use your finger to gently pull the lower eyelid so that the margin is visible. Holding a cotton linen in another hand, scrub several times along the eyelid margin where the eye lash meets the skin. | ​ |
| ​​7. Rinse under the tap water or use a damp face towel to clean away the eyelid cleanser especially at the eye lashes region. | ​ |

**Warm Compress**

Applying warm compress can help to loosen the debris or crusts on the lashes, allowing for easier removal with the eyelid cleanser.
