What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Zuclopenthixol depot Injection belongs to a class of medications known as typical (first-generation) antipsychotics. It is used to treat and prevent the return of symptoms in Schizophrenia and other mental health related conditions such as:

* Hearing, seeing or sensing things that are not real
* Having mistaken beliefs
* Uncontrolled anger
* Being overly suspicious

A depot injection is a special preparation of medication which is given in the form of an injection into the upper arm, thigh or buttocks. The medication is then slowly released and absorbed to the rest of the body over a number of weeks.

Zuclopenthixol depot Injection may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* A small dose of the medication, called a test dose, will usually be given when you are started on this medication to help avoid any prolonged and severe side effects.
* If you have no side effects from the test dose, you may be given an additional dose, called a top-up dose, a few days or up to a week after the test dose.
* Subsequent injections will be given at regular intervals. The interval between each injection will be decided by your doctor (e.g. every 2 to 4 weeks).
* It is important for you to be regular with your scheduled depot injections at the clinic. Missing your injections for too long a time (e.g. several weeks or months) may result in a recurrence of your previous symptoms.
