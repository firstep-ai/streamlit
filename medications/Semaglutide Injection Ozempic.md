Ozempic® is used to help control blood sugar in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Learn how to use the medication, its common side effects, special precautions to watch out for, and more.

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Ozempic® is used to help control blood sugar in patients with Type 2 diabetes.  Ozempic® reduces food cravings and increases the insulin produced during meals. Ozempic® also helps to lower the chances of a heart attack, stroke, and death in patients with type 2 diabetes with known heart disease.

This medication does not replace insulin.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Ozempic® is given once a week through injection under the skin. Inject the dose as advised by your doctor.
* The usual starting dose is 0.25 mg once a week for four weeks.
* After four weeks, your doctor will usually increase the dose to 0.5 mg once a week if you can tolerate the medication.
* After at least four weeks with a dose of 0.5 mg once weekly, your doctor may increase your dose further to 1 mg once a week if your blood sugar is not well-controlled.
* You should use Ozempic® on the same day each week if possible.
* If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly injection of Ozempic®, as long as it has been at least 2 days since your last Ozempic® injection. After selecting a new dosing day, the once-weekly dosing should be continued.
* Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* You may use this medication with or without food.

**How to select an injection site:**

Ozempic® should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You can choose to inject to your upper arms, thigh or abdomen.

You should rotate the injection site every week to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).

**How to inject Semaglutide:**

Read the instruction leaflet or approach your healthcare professional for more details.

**Step 1: Prepare your pen with a new needle**

1. Before injecting Ozempic®, check the injection pen.
   1. The solution in the pen should be clear and colorless.
2. Attach a new needle to the Ozempic®pen.
3. Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later.
4. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away.

**Step 2: First time use for each NEW pen: check the flow**

Before your first injection with each new pen, you will need to check the flow of the pen.

You do not need to check the flow of the pen that is already in use.

1. Turn the dose selector to the flow check symbol right past ‘0’. Make sure the flow check symbol lines up with the pointer.
2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing up.
3. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to ‘0’.
4. A drop of solution should appear at the needle tip.
5. If no drop appears, repeat these steps up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle and repeat these steps once more. Discard the pen and use a new one if a drop of solution still does not appear.

**Step 3: Select your dose**

1. Turn the dose selector to your prescribed dose.

**Step 4: Inject the dose**

1. Wash your hands before and after you use this medication.
2. Clean the skin before injecting.
3. Lift a skin fold. Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin.
4. Make sure that you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers.
5. Press and hold down the dose button so the dose counter returns to '0'.
6. Continue pressing the dose button while keeping the needle in your skin.
7. Count slowly to 6

**Step 5: After the injection**

1. Remove the needle from your skin while keeping the dose button pressed. This is to ensure that you get the full dose.
2. Do not rub or massage the injection site.
3. Throw the injection needle after each injection. Do not re-use the needles.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you forget to inject Ozempic®, it should be administered as soon as you remember within 5 days after the missed dose. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.

If more than 5 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day.

Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
