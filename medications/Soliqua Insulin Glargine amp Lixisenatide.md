# Soliqua (Insulin Glargine &amp; Lixisenatide)

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Soliqua® is an injection that contains two medications: Insulin Glargine and Lixisenatide.

These medications help to control diabetes.

Insulin glargine is long-acting and helps to lower blood sugar throughout the day.

Lixisenatide works by slowing the movement of food from your stomach to the small intestine, hence slowing down absorption of sugars into the body. It also regulates the amount of insulin made by your body in a sugar-dependent manner.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Soliqua® is to be injected once a day.
* Soliqua® should be injected 1 hour before meal, preferably the same meal every day, with the most convenient meal.
* Inject Soliqua® into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer on the upper arms, thighs or tummy (abdomen).
* Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.
* Ensure that the liquid is clear and colourless before use.
* Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen.

What are some common side effects of this medication?
-----------------------------------------------------

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

The common side effects of Glargine and Lixisenatide include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhoea
* Stuffy or runny nose
* Sore throat
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Hunger
* Sweating
* Trembling
* Blurred vision
* Walking unsteadily
* Fast heartbeat

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately:

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

* 3 glucose tablets or
* Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
* Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
* 1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
* 3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes.

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on.

Inform your doctor about your low blood sugar event during your next clinic visit.  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

* Inject too much insulin
* Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
* Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
* Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
* Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
* Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

* Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions.
* They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks.
* See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed.

What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

  + Severe pain in the stomach, abdomen or back area
  + Nausea or vomiting that does not go away

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).
