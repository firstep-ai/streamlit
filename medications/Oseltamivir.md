# Oseltamivir

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Oseltamivir is used to prevent or treat infections caused by influenza viruses (Type A and B). It is an antiviral medication that works by preventing the release of influenza viruses from infected cells, thereby preventing new rounds of infection.

Oseltamivir is not a substitute for influenza vaccination.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

* The capsules may be opened to provide the correct dosage when given for a child or for those who cannot swallow. As powder from the capsules can be irritating to the skin and eyes, open the capsules with care. If powder comes in contact with eyes or skin, rinse with plenty of water immediately.

For patients who cannot swallow the capsules:

* Carefully open one capsule and pour all the powder into a plastic cup.
* Add 10mL of water to the plastic cup and mix for 2 minutes.
* Use the syringe to measure out the prescribed volume and discard the remaining mixture.
* Add the mixture measured out to a small volume of one of the following sweetened liquids listed below and serve to your child.
* For doses which are the full dose of the capsule: If there is some mixture left in the plastic cup, rinse the cup with a small amount of water and drink it all.
