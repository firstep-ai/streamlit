# Aspirin

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Aspirin (also known as Acetylsalicylic acid) is used to prevent blood clots from forming by making the blood less ‘sticky’. By preventing blood clots, this reduces the risk of you having a heart attack or stroke.

You may be given Aspirin if you have a blockage in your blood vessels or after heart surgery.

Aspirin can also be prescribed after Kawasaki disease (a condition whereby there is inflammation in the blood vessels) for four to six weeks, or longer if your doctor feels that it is necessary due to any abnormalities of the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients.

Aspirin may also be used at higher doses to relieve pain and fever or for anti-inflammatory purposes. Inform your healthcare professional if you wish to consume Aspirin to relieve pain or fever.

Aspirin may be started during pregnancy in certain women to prevent the development of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition that usually presents as high blood pressure with or without protein in the urine. Aspirin is normally taken at night for this purpose.

What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patients taking Aspirin may have increased risk of bleeding. If you experience any serious bleeding, you should stop your medication and inform your healthcare professional immediately. Serious bleeding may include one or more of the following:

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.

Very rarely, Aspirin may cause Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious condition that affects the brain and liver in young children. However, this has only been mostly seen in children less than 5 years of age, who have had a viral illness (chickenpox or flu) or are on prolonged, high-dose Aspirin. Symptoms of Reye’s syndrome include:
