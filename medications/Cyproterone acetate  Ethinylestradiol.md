What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Estelle™-35/35 ED contains two types of sex hormones, a progestogen called Cyproterone acetate and an estrogen called Ethinylestradiol. It is used in women of reproductive age who suffer from conditions due to an increased sensitivity to androgens in the body. Androgens are hormones in the body that make one display more male characteristics. Women who are more sensitive to androgen may have conditions such as acne, very oily skin or excessive hair growth in certain areas of the face or body. The medication also provides effective oral contraception in women being treated for the above conditions.

If you are taking Estelle™-35/35 ED for any of the conditions above, you must not take any other hormonal contraceptive at the same time.

Estelle™-35 and Estelle™-35 ED is a 21 day and 28 day pack, respectively. The only difference between them is that Estelle™-35 ED contains additional 7 (white) inactive tablets in the 28-day pack.
