Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

EVRA® is a combined hormonal contraceptive medication that contains two types of sex hormones, an estrogen called ethinylestradiol and a progestogen called norelgestromin. This medication can help to prevent ovulation and regulates other naturally occurring hormones in the body. When used correctly, this prevents pregnancy and promotes regular menstrual bleeding.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* If you are switching from other forms of contraception, please seek advice from your healthcare professional.
* For the first pack of Evra®, you may apply the first patch on the first day of your menses (if this is your first time using hormonal contraceptives or restarting this medication after a break).
* If you are also using it for contraceptive purposes, a barrier method of contraception (e.g. condoms) is recommended for the first 7 days of using this medication.
* You should apply a new patch ONCE A WEEK for 3 weeks and stop for 1 week (7-day patch-free interval), during which you will experience withdrawal bleeding (menses).
* Wear the patch for exactly seven days for 3 weeks and change the patch on the same day every week (“Patch Change Day”).
* After the 7-day patch-free interval, apply a new patch even if you are still having menstrual bleeding.

| --- | --- |
| ​ | * ​Always put your patch on **clean, dry and hairless skin.** * Put it on the **buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm or upper back** – in places where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. * Do not put on the breast or skin that is red, irritated or cut. * Do not use adhesives or wraps to hold the patch in place * Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powder or other skin care products on the application site. The patch may not stick well. * Put the new patch on a different area of the skin each time to reduce skin irritation. |
| ​ | * Do not use scissors to open the foil pouch. Use your fingers to open the pouch by tearing it along the edge. * There is a clear protective covering on the patch. * Peel away half of the clear protective covering (*refer picture*). Try not to touch the sticky surface. *(Some patches might stick to the inside of the sachet.**Be careful not to remove the clear covering as you remove the patch)* |
| ​ | * ​Put the patch on your skin. * Take off the other half of the covering. * Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds. * Make sure the edges stick well. * Check your patch every day to make sure it is still stuck firmly and has not fallen off. |

* Normal activities (e.g. bathing or showering, using a sauna or exercising) should not affect how well the patch works. The patch is designed to stay in place during these activities. However, you should check that the patch has not fallen off after doing these activities.

| **If the patch becomes loose, lifts at the edges or falls off:** | |
| **For less than one day (up to 24 hours)** | **​For more than one day (24 hours or more) or**  **if you are not sure for how long** |
| * Try to put it on again or put on a new patch immediately. * No back-up contraception is needed. * Your “Patch Change Day” remains the same. * Do not use adhesives or wraps to keep the patch in place. * Put on a new patch immediately, if:  + it is no longer sticky + it has become stuck to itself or another surface + it has other material stuck to it + it is the second time it has become looser or has fallen off | * Start a new cycle immediately by putting on a new patch. * You now have a new Day 1 and a new “Patch Change Day”. * Use a barrier method such as a condom for the first week of your new cycle. |
