# Tocilizumab

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Tocilizumab is an Interleukin-6 inhibitor (IL-6i). IL-6i belongs to a class of medication called biologics or more specifically, biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).

Biologics are small molecules that work by blocking certain parts of the immune system that cause inflammation in the body.

IL-6i targets and blocks natural substances called cytokines which causes inflammation in the body. This improves symptoms, reduces flares, slows disease progression and improves quality of life.

It may be used alone or together with other DMARDs.

-----------------------------------------

* Tocilizumab may be given as

  + subcutaneous injection (inject under the skin at the abdomen or thigh). This can be done by yourself at home.
  + Intravenous infusion (inject into the blood vessel). This has to be done in the hospital or clinic for typically 1 hour.
* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
* Other medications such as corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be taken with Tocilizumab.
