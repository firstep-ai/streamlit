# Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine

Vaccine Information Leaflet

​What is the Varicella Vaccine Used For?
----------------------------------------

Varicella vaccines help to prevent chickenpox, which is a highly infectious disease caused by the Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). 

Chickenpox spreads from one person to another through direct contact or via droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread indirectly through objects freshly contaminated by droplets or fluid from the blisters of an infected person.

Common symptoms of chickenpox include a fever, with red itchy spots on the body and face. The spots appear over a few days, become fluid-filled blisters and form crusts before healing.

Who Should Receive the Varicella Vaccine?
-----------------------------------------

As part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), all children should receive two doses from age 12 months onwards, at least 3 months apart.

As part of the Singapore National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), adults (18 years or older) who have not been previously vaccinated, or lack evidence of past infection or immunity should receive 2 doses (1st dose, followed by 2nd dose within four to eight weeks of the 1st dose).
