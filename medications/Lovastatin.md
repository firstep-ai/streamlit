# Lovastatin

Medication Information Leaflet

What is this medication for?
----------------------------

Lovastatin belongs to the class of medications called Statins (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Statins lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) and ‘fat’ (triglyceride) in the blood as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol).

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, statins may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.

How should I take or use this medication?
-----------------------------------------

* Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your ‘bad cholesterol’ level may rise again.
* You should take this medication with or after food, at night.

What should I do if I forget to take or use this medication?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.
